## General Information
Being a parent during a global pandemic was one of the hardest parts of being a parent. 
Many parents decided to homeschool their children traditionally and it posed some very difficult situations. 
One of the main issues was keeping track of all the hours and lessons each student had been taught in each subject. 
I've come up with a web application thatâ€™s simple to use for organizing all these very important metrics needed to meet state requirements. 
## Technologies
* Java 
* Spring Boot
* Hibernate
* MySQL
* Thymeleaf
* Bootstrap 4
* Spring MVC
* Spring Data
* HTML/CSS
## Features
*	User can create and authenticate accounts
*	Users can create, read, edit and delete students, subjects, notes entered and hours tracked
*	User can upload pictures or avatar for each student
*	Users can download CSV of each students subjects and hours learned
## Status
This project is still being developed. Future changes included UI improvements, feature upgrades and error alerts.
