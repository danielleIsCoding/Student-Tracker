Many parents decided to homeschool their children traditionally and it posed some very difficult situations. 
One of the main issues is keeping track of all the hours and lessons each student has been taught in each subject. In response to this problemmy solution
was a web application thatâ€™s simple to use for organizing all these very important metrics needed to meet state requirements.
